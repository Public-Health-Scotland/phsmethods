# phsmethods: Standard Methods for Use in Public Health Scotland

A collection of methods for commonly undertaken analytical tasks,
primarily developed for Public Health Scotland (PHS) analysts, but the
package is also generally useful to others working in the healthcare
space, particularly since it has functions for working with Community
Health Index (CHI) numbers. The package can help to make data
manipulation and analysis more efficient and reproducible.
