}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a CHI number or a vector of CHI numbers with \code{character} class.}
}
\description{
\code{chi_pad} takes a nine-digit CHI number with
\code{character} class and prefixes it with a zero. Any values provided
which are not nine characters in length remain unchanged.
}
\details{
The Community Health Index (CHI) is a register of all patients in
NHS Scotland. A CHI number is a unique, ten-digit identifier assigned to
each patient on the index.

The first six digits of a CHI number are a patient's date of birth in
DD/MM/YY format. The first digit of a CHI number must, therefore, be 3 or
less. Depending on the source, CHI numbers are sometimes mising a leading
zero.

While a CHI number is made up exclusively of numeric digits, it cannot be
stored with \code{numeric} class in R. This is because leading zeros in
numeric values are silently dropped, a practice not exclusive to R. For this
reason, \code{chi_pad} accepts input values of \code{character} class
only, and returns values of the same class. It does not assess the validity
of a CHI number - please see \code{\link{chi_check}} for that.
